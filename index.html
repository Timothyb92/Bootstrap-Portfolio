                                <p>My name is Tim Bedsole and I am a fullstack web development student at UCF's Coding Boot Camp! Although I'm not from the Orlando area, I'm a Florida boy born and raised.
                                    I have worked a few years in retail, and the most recent two and a half years as a licensed pharmacy technician working in a metal health facility - largely in a crisis stabilization environment.
                                    Although working in a field that allows me to help others who are in mental and emotional distress is incrediby rewarding, I have learned that I am not meant for a life in the field of pharmacy.
                                    I've always love computers and wanted to learn more and make a career of writing code. UCF's Coding Boot Camp seemed like the perfect opportunity for me, and it's in my own back yard here in Florida.

                                    Outside of work life I enjoy traveling with my wife and learning about different cultures.
                                    I try to spend some time every week improving my Korean. My wife is from South Korea, so it helps to have a personal tutor.
                                    At this point in my language learning journey I'm able to hold a conversation for the most part, but talking with my in-laws is still a bit difficult at times.
